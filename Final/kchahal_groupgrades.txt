Kairavi Chahal | Group: Tony Yang, Julian Zhou
36-350 Final Project

Division of Work:

We all collaborated on all aspects of the project, rather than dividing up the
work. In the code, Tony and I worked as a team on the compute_markov() function,
which took the longest to complete. Meanwhile, Julian worked on the comparison
and simulation functions. The presentation was similarly done, with all of us
contributing to it online. Julian made most of the R graphs, while Tony and I
actually did the analysis. I made some of the other charts used in explaining
our algorithms. All three of us had contributed equally to the written content
of the slides.

Overall, Tony did about 30 percent of the work while Julian and I did 35 percent
each. I think this was completely fair as Tony had other projects he was working
on as well, and he still showed up to all group meetings.

Grades:

Tony Yang: I think Tony should get a 90 as he did not significantly contribute
           to the conceptual ideas of our project and simply did the parts we 
           told him to do. However, he always did his part.

Julian Zhou: I think Julian deserves a 100 as he knew the most about our project
             topic and was eager to work on the project even after the group
             meetings were over.
